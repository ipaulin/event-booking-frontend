Simple front-end app for CRUD operations on events & bookings; built with ReactJS and GraphQL.

Didn't spend too much time on CSS and design, so most parts are built with Tailwind CSS.

### TODO:
* implement auth token storage, so that it persists in app on refresh
* refactor code, move API calls outside of components
* better handle input error messages
* reduce DB queries
* use Prisma
